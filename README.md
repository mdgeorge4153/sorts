== sorts ==

The goal of this project is two-fold:

1. provide a visualization and comparison of in-place sorting algorithms
2. to demonstrate monadic software design

== Compiling ==

This project is built using OCaml and depends on Jane Street's Core library.
The easiest way to get these is to install opam and then use opam to install
core.

You can then compile the program by running "make".

== Running ==

To run the program, simply invoke "main.native" with the name of the sorts you
want to run.  For example:

./main.native insertion quicksort heapsort

Running main.native with no arguments will cause the available sorting
algorithms to be listed.  Running with -h will show additional options


=== Tab completion ===

This program also supports custom bash tab completion.  Simply source the
"complete.sh" script that is generated by make: ". complete.sh".


== Writing new sorting routines ==

TODO: better doc

See the existing sorts in the sorts/ folder.  Edit main.ml and add new sorts to
the "sorts" list.
